# get-lit
Just a silly game thrown together at a ACM@UIUC Gamebuilders gamathon.

# To Run

1. Download (https://love2d.org/)[love2d].
2. Open repo directory in terminal.
3. `path\to\love.exe .`

# To Play

Keep running and try not to get lit.

* `Space` to jump
* Hold `Shift` to slow and decrease jump height
* `Q` to use a douse charge

The more times you get lit, the faster your health drops.  A douse charge will stop the burning and slowly regen health until lit again.
